Colour-Scheme-Blending
======================

[Intuitive tool](http://atelierbram.github.io/Colour-Scheme-Blending/ "Colour Scheme Blend Tool demo page on Github") for quick finding and testing (harmonious) colour blends with selected colours from a colour scheme. Drag and drop semi-transparent circles on different colour background, then use a colour-picker to get the colour-codes.
